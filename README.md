# The PCBs for the 2x2 Macropad

This is a 2x2 Macropad with per-key RGB backlighting. It uses the RP2040 microcontroller and uses a custom firmware located at [https://github.com/arfrie22/2x2macropad_firmware](https://github.com/arfrie22/2x2macropad_firmware).

The PCBs are designed in KiCad

## Features

- Custom lighting effects
- Support for normal keys and media keys
- Keys can act as a key or used for a custom macro
- Up to 4 macros per key
- Customizable timing

## Building

The interactive BOM is can be viewed [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arfrie22/2x2macropad_pcbs/main/pcb/bom/ibom.html).

There are 3 pcbs in this project:

- The main pcb, which contains all of the components
- The top plate, which holds the keyswitches
- The bottom plate, which protects the components

## Info

This project was created for a workshop hosted by the UMass All Campus Makerspace. The keyboard was designed to have as many parts as I could reasonably have be though-hole, while keeping the cost relativly low.
